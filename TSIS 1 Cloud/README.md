# TSIS 1: Cloud-Based Strategic Audit & AI Implementation (Halyk Bank)

## Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive strategic audit of **Halyk Bank's** internal processes, specifically focusing on the **SME Onboarding** bottleneck. Using Cloud-based AI tools (Google Gemini API), I conducted a deep-dive analysis to identify root causes of operational delays and proposed a technical solution integrated with ESG and regulatory standards.



## Project Structure
The repository is organized into three specialized directories:

* **`/code`**: Contains Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts for AI-driven discovery.
* **`/docs`**: Contains the final Product Requirements Document (PRD) generated by the AI agent.
* **`/data_sources`**: Reference materials, including official Halyk Bank annual and sustainability reports.



## Analysis Conducted

### 1. Root Cause Analysis (The "5 Whys" Method)
Using a custom-built **AI Interview Agent** (`Interview_Agent.py`), I simulated a discovery session with a Senior Product Manager.
* **Problem identified:** SME onboarding takes >48 hours due to manual legal review.
* **Deepest Root Cause:** Absence of a "Citation Engine" in AI tools, preventing legal teams from trusting automated risk scores during audits by the National Bank of Kazakhstan.

### 2. Strategic Context Engineering
Through a series of Jupyter Notebooks, I mapped the business ecosystem:
* **Analysis Framework:** Evaluated the intersection of Big Data and Legal Compliance.
* **JTBD (Jobs To Be Done):** Identified that the "Job" is not just to onboard a client, but to do so with 100% audit-readiness.
* **Managerial Defense:** Prepared documentation to defend AI implementation costs to bank stakeholders.

### 3. ESG & Compliance Audit
I analyzed the **2024 Sustainability and Annual Reports** to ensure the proposed AI solution aligns with:
* Transparency in decision-making (Governance).
* Reducing paper-based manual processes (Environmental).



## Code & Technologies Used
* **Language:** Python 3.10+
* **AI Model:** Google Gemini 1.5 Flash (via `google-generativeai` SDK).
* **Environment:** Cloud-ready script with `.env` configuration for secure API management.
* **Data Science:** Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) for iterative context engineering and data mapping.



## How to Run the Discovery Agent
1. Navigate to `/code`.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install google-generativeai python-dotenv`.
3. Add your `GOOGLE_API_KEY` to the `.env` file.
4. Run: `python Interview_Agent.py`.
