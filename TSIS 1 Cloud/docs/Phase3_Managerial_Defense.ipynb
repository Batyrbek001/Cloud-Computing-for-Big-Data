Building on Phase 1 (which identified Halyk as a \"Digital Immigrant\") and Phase 2 (which uncovered \"Explainability Fatigue\" and legal officer burnout), this phase evaluates the project's financial sustainability and its alignment with Kazakhstan’s strict banking secrecy and AI ethical standards. We must prove that this AI doesn't just increase speed, but significantly mitigates operational and regulatory risk."
