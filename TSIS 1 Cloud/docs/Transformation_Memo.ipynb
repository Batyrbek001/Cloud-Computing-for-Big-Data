        "Halyk Bank is currently a \"Digital Immigrant\" operating as a high-performing Feature Factory. While the bank has achieved massive scale through the digitization of traditional banking services, it remains trapped in an \"IT Service\" mindset. The current structure relies on top-down, stakeholder-driven roadmaps that treat technology as a cost center rather than the core business driver. To survive the next wave of fintech disruption, Halyk must move away from \"mercenary\" delivery teams toward empowered missionary teams that own customer outcomes."

        "\n",
        "  * **Risk:** This creates a mercenary culture where engineers are told what to build (output) rather than being responsible for how it solves a customer problem (outcome).\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Stakeholder-Driven Roadmap (Lack of Empowerment):**\n",

        "* **Project-Based Funding vs. Product Persistence:**\n",

        "* **Mandate Product Discovery:** Before any \"IT project\" is funded, teams must prove they have validated the Value, Usability, Feasibility, and Viability of the solution through prototyping and user testing.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Shift from \"Approving Features\" to \"Assigning Problems\":** The Board should move to an OKR (Objectives and Key Results) model. Instead of demanding \"Feature X,\" the Board should demand an outcome, such as \"Reduce Corporate Onboarding Time from 48 hours to 4 hours\".\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Invest in Explainable AI (XAI) for Governance:** Deploy internal agents like \"Halyk LegalEye\" to bridge the gap between digital speed and legal accountability, ensuring that technology supports human judgment rather than replacing it with \"black box\" logic."
